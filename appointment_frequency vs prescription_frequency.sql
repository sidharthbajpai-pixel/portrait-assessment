--we can conclude Very weak negative correlation between appointment frequency and prescription frequency. The number is close to 0, so thereâ€™s almost no linear relationship.
--
--The slight negative value suggests that as appointments increase, prescriptions very slightly decrease, but this effect is extremely weak and likely not meaningful.
